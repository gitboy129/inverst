===========


**django-nose** provides all the goodness of `nose`_ in your Django tests, like:

* Testing just your apps by default, not all the standard ones that happen to
  be in ``INSTALLED_APPS``
* Running the tests in one or more specific modules (or apps, or classes, or
  folders, or just running a specific test)
* Obviating the need to import all your tests into ``tests/__init__.py``.
  This not only saves busy-work but also eliminates the possibility of
  accidentally shadowing test classes.
* Taking advantage of all the useful `nose plugins`_

.. _nose plugins: http://nose-plugins.jottit.com/

It also provides:

* Fixture bundling, an optional feature which speeds up your fixture-based
  tests by a factor of 4
* Reuse of previously created test DBs, cutting 10 seconds off startup time
* Hygienic TransactionTestCases, which can save you a DB flush per test
* Support for various databases. Tested with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
  Others should work as well.

django-nose requires nose 1.2.1 or later, and the `latest release`_ is
recommended.  It follows the `Django's support policy`_, supporting:

* Django 1.8 (LTS) with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5
* Django 1.9 with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5
* Django 1.10 with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5
* Django 1.11 (LTS) with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6
* Django 2.0 with Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7
* Django 2.1 with Python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7

Installation
------------

You can get django-nose from PyPI with... :

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install django-nose

The development version can be installed with... :

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install -e git://github.com/django-nose/django-nose.git#egg=django-nose

Since django-nose extends Django's built-in test command, you should add it to
your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_nose',
        ...
    )

Then set ``TEST_RUNNER`` in ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    TEST_RUNNER = 'django_nose.NoseTestSuiteRunner'

1.1 (2012-05-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Django TransactionTestCases don't clean up after themselves; they leave
  junk in the DB and clean it up only on ``_pre_setup``. Thus, Django makes
  sure these tests run last. Now django-nose does, too. This means one fewer
  source of failures on existing projects. (Erik Rose)
* Add support for hygienic TransactionTestCases. (Erik Rose)
* Support models that are used only for tests. Just put them in any file
  imported in the course of loading tests. No more crazy hacks necessary.
  (Erik Rose)
* Make the fixture bundler more conservative, fixing some conceivable
  situations in which fixtures would not appear as intended if a
  TransactionTestCase found its way into the middle of a bundle. (Erik Rose)
* Fix an error that would surface when using SQLAlchemy with connection
  pooling. (Roger Hu)
* Gracefully ignore the new ``--liveserver`` option introduced in Django 1.4;
  don't let it through to nose. (Adam DePue)

1.0 (2012-03-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* New fixture-bundling plugin for avoiding needless fixture setup (Erik Rose)
* Moved FastFixtureTestCase in from test-utils, so now all the
  fixture-bundling stuff is in one library. (Erik Rose)
* Added the REUSE_DB setting for faster startup and shutdown. (Erik Rose)
* Fixed a crash when printing options with certain verbosities. (Daniel Abel)
* Broke hard dependency on MySQL. Support PostgreSQL. (Roger Hu)
* Support SQLite, both memory- and disk-based. (Roger Hu and Erik Rose)
* Nail down versions of the package requirements. (Daniel Mizyrycki)
